    <p style="color: #808080;">Once upon a time, aboard the cursed ship known as the Flying Dutchman, Captain Vanderdecken and his phantom crew were bound to sail the stormy seas for all eternity. The captain had made a deal with the Devil himself, promising to round the Cape of Good Hope in a single night. When he failed, the Devil condemned them to their ghostly fate.

On one particularly stormy night, as the Flying Dutchman traversed the inky-black waves, a fierce storm broke out, unlike any the cursed crew had seen before. The wind howled like a tortured soul, and the ocean roared, churning up colossal waves that threatened to consume the ship.</p>
